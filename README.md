FAQ
---

*Q:* The output looks like a mess in `TTY/PuTTY/other`!
*A:* Yeah, sorry. If you find a fix, send me a pull request.

*Q:* Which programs do you use to generate the pony files?
*A:* The pony files are actually mostly a bunch of selected [browser ponies](http://web.student.tuwien.ac.at/~e0427417/browser-ponies/ponies.html), converted using [util-say](https://github.com/maandree/util-say).
